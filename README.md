This project is to examplify how to develop OpenCV C++ algorithms on Mac using Xcode. This project shows how to read images from disk, read images or frames from a video on disk and reading images or frames from the webcam.

The project makes use exclusively of OpenCV code over the standard library to allow the project to be portable to other systems such as Linux and Windows.
